    <h2>She's awfully lazy and disobidient. She loves climbing so I assume she was a cat in her previous life. Her favorite food is:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Salad tomato</li>
        <li>Red peppers</li>
        <li>Apples</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>What should we think about it?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Looks like she's vegan</li>
        <li>But she also eat beef steaks</li>
    </ol>
